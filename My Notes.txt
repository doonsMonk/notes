
FUNCTION OVERRIDING : If derived class defines same function as defined in its base class, it is known as function overriding in C++.

FUNCTION OVERLOADING : It provides multiple definitions of the function by changing signature i.e changing number of parameters, 
change datatype of parameters, return type doesn’t play anyrole.

"POLYMORPHISM" literally means "many forms". 

PARAMETRIC POLYMORPHISM : is when the same code can be applied to multiple data types.

AD-HOC POLYMORPHISM : is when different code is used for different data-types. Overloading falls into this category.
Or Same data types but different code , overriding falls into this category.

VIRTUAL FUCNTIONS : It is a function in base class, which is overrided in the derived class, and which tells the compiler to perform 
Late Binding on this function.

Virtual Keyword is used to make a member function of the base class Virtual. In Late Binding function call is resolved at runtime. 
Hence, now compiler determines the type of object at runtime, and then binds the function call. Late Binding is also called Dynamic 
Binding or Runtime Binding.

We can call private function of derived class from the base class pointer with the help of virtual keyword. Compiler checks for access 
specifier only at compile time. So at run time when late binding occurs it does not check whether we are calling the private function 
or public function.

To accomplich late binding, Compiler creates VTABLEs, for each class with virtual function. The address of virtual functions is inserted 
into these tables. Whenever an object of such class is created the compiler secretly inserts a pointer called vpointer, pointing to 
VTABLE for that object. Hence when function is called, compiler is able to resovle the call by binding the correct function using the 
vpointer.

Virtual functions provides a loose coupling because the program does not have to change drastically if a new concrete derived class 
of base class is added anytime. The reason is that there are minimal code segments that actually use (depend) on the concrete type.

With virtual functions we can achieve as example of the Open Closed Principle of the famous SOLID design principles.

As per C++ STANDARDS: If a function in Base class is declared virtual and the same signature function is present in derived class then
that function also becomes virtual. Doesnt matter virtual keyword is present or not.

Member function templates cannot be declared virtual. This constraint is imposed because the usual implementation of the virtual 
function call mechanism uses a fixed-size table with one entry per virtual function. However, the number of instantiations of a 
member function template is not fixed until the entire program has been translated. Hence, supporting virtual member function templates 
would require support for a whole new kind of mechanism in C++ compilers and linkers. In contrast, the ordinary members of class 
templates can be virtual because their number is fixed when a class is instantiated

An override in front of derived class function can help avoid bugs by producing a compilation error when the intended override isn't 
technically an override. 

Where are the Vtables created?:

Depends on compiler.

In VC++, the vtable pointer stored at the beginning of the object allocation, before any member data. 
(Provided your class has at least one virtual member function.)

There also may be multiple vtable pointers, if your class multiply-inherits from other classes with vtables.

The vtables themselves are statically allocated somewhere in your address space.

Then the object layout looks like (for an instance of C):

A's VTable ptr
A's member variables.
B's Vtable ptr
B's member variables.
C's member variables.
for the heirarchy

class A {
  virtual Ax() {}
  int a, b;
};
class B {
  virtual Bx() {}
  int c, d;
};
class C : public A, public B {
  int foo, bar;
};

Virtual Constructors:
There is nothing like Virtual Constructor. The Constructor can’t be virtual as the constructor is a code which is responsible for creating 
an instance of a class and it can’t be delegated to any other object by virtual keyword means.

A virtual call is a mechanism to get work done given partial information. In particular, "virtual" allows us to call a function knowing 
only any interfaces and not the exact type of the object. To create an object you need complete information. In particular, you need to 
know the exact type of what you want to create. Consequently, a "call to a constructor" cannot be virtual.

To construct an object, a constructor needs the exact type of the object it is to create. Furthermore you cannot have a pointer to a constructor.

We can achieve virtual constructor behaviour from Design patters : Factory Design Pattern or Abstract Factory Design pattern.

Before we jump into factory pattern lets know about Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes:
Sometimes implementation of all function cannot be provided in a base class because we don’t know the implementation. Such a class is called
abstract class. A pure virtual function (or abstract function) in C++ is a virtual function for which we don’t have implementation, we only 
declare it. A pure virtual function is declared by assigning 0 in declaration.
A class is abstract if it has at least one pure virtual function.
We can have pointers and references of abstract class type.
If we do not override the pure virtual function in derived class, then derived class also becomes abstract class.
An abstract class can have constructors.

Factory Design Pattern:

class Toy
{
public:
	virtual void createparts()=0;
	virtual void combineparts()=0;
	virtual void assembleparts()=0;
	virtual void applylabel()=0;
};

class biketoy: public Toy
{
public:
    	void createparts() {cout<<"Creating biketoy parts";}
	void combineparts(){cout<<"Combining biketoy parts";}
	void assembleparts(){cout<<"Assembling biketoy parts";}
	void applylabel(){cout<<"BikeToy complete";}  
};

class cartoy: public Toy
{
public:
    	void createparts() {cout<<"Creating cartoy parts";}
	void combineparts(){cout<<"Combining cartoy parts";}
	void assembleparts(){cout<<"Assembling cartoy parts";}
	void applylabel(){cout<<"cartoy complete";}  
};

class animaltoy: public Toy
{
public:
    	void createparts() {cout<<"Creating animaltoy parts";}
	void combineparts(){cout<<"Combining animaltoy parts";}
	void assembleparts(){cout<<"Assembling animaltoy parts";}
	void applylabel(){cout<<"animaltoy complete";}  
};

class ToyFactory
{
public:
 static Toy* createtoy(int toytype)
 {
	Toy* ptr = NULL;
	switch(toytype)
	{
	case 1:
	ptr = new biketoy;
	break;
	case 2:
	ptr = new cartoy;
	break
	case 3:
	ptr = new animaltoy;
	break;
	deafult:
	assert(false); // unknown toy type
	break;
	}
	ptr->createparts();
	ptr->combineparts();
	ptr->assembleparts();
	ptr->applylabel();
	return ptr;
 }
};

int main
{
	biketoy *newbiketoy = ToyFactory::createtoy(1);
	cartoy *newcartoy = ToyFactory::createtoy(2);
	animaltoy *newanimaltoy = ToyFactory::createtoy(3);
	delete newbiketoy;
	delete newcartoy;
	delete newanimaltoy;
	return 0;
}

Abstract Factory Design Pattern is factory of Factories:

Conversion Constructor:
In C++, if a class has a constructor which can be called with a single argument, then this constructor becomes conversion constructor 
because such a constructor allows automatic conversion to the class being constructed.


#include<iostream> 
  
using namespace std; 
class Test  
{ 
 private: 
   int x; 
 public: 
   Test(int i) {x = i;} 
   void show() { cout<<" x = "<<x<<endl; } 
}; 
  
int main() 
{ 
 Test t(20); 
 t.show(); 
 t = 30; // conversion constructor is called here. 
 t.show(); 
 getchar(); 
 return 0; 
} 


Conversion operator:
In C++, the programmer abstracts real world objects using classes as concrete types. Sometimes it is required to convert one concrete type 
to another concrete type or primitive type implicitly. Conversion operators play smart role in such situations.
class Boo
{
	double value;
public:
	Boo(double i ) {value = i;}
	operator double()
	{
		return value;
	}
};
Boo BooObject;
double i = BooObject; // assigning object to variable i of type double.
now conversion operator gets called to assign the value.

Stack Unwinding:
When an exception is thrown and control passes from a try block to a handler, the C++ run time calls destructors for all automatic objects
constructed since the beginning of the try block. This process is called stack unwinding. The automatic objects are destroyed in reverse 
order of their construction. (Automatic objects are local objects that have been declared auto or register, or not declared static or 
extern. An automatic object x is deleted whenever the program exits the block in which x is declared.)

If an exception is thrown during construction of an object consisting of subobjects or array elements, destructors are only called for 
those subobjects or array elements successfully constructed before the exception was thrown. A destructor for a local static object will 
only be called if the object was successfully constructed.

If during stack unwinding a destructor throws an exception and that exception is not handled, the terminate() function is called. 
The following example demonstrates this:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct E {
  const char* message;
  E(const char* arg) : message(arg) { }
};

void my_terminate() {
  cout << "Call to my_terminate" << endl;
};

struct A {
  A() { cout << "In constructor of A" << endl; }
  ~A() {
    cout << "In destructor of A" << endl;
    throw E("Exception thrown in ~A()");
  }
};

struct B {
  B() { cout << "In constructor of B" << endl; }
  ~B() { cout << "In destructor of B" << endl; }
};

int main() {
  set_terminate(my_terminate);

  try {
    cout << "In try block" << endl;
    A a;
    B b;
    throw("Exception thrown in try block of main()");
  }
  catch (const char* e) {
    cout << "Exception: " << e << endl;
  }
  catch (...) {
    cout << "Some exception caught in main()" << endl;
  }

  cout << "Resume execution of main()" << endl;
}

The output of this example:
In try block
In constructor of A
In constructor of B
In destructor of B
In destructor of A
Call to my_terminate

In the try block, two automatic objects are created: a and b. The try block throws an exception of type const char*. The handler 
catch (const char* e) catches this exception. The C++ run time unwinds the stack, calling the destructors for a and b in reverse 
order of their construction. The destructor for a throws an exception. Since there is no handler in the program that can handle 
this exception, the C++ run time calls terminate(). (The function terminate() calls the function specified as the argument to 
set_terminate(). In this example, terminate() has been specified to call my_terminate().)


How can I handle a constructor that fails?
A: throw an exception. Constructors don't have a return type, so it's not possible to use return codes. The best way to signal 
constructor failure is therefore to throw an exception.

How can I handle a destructor that fails?
A: Write a message to a log-_le. But do not throw an exception. The C++ rule is that you mustnever throw an exception from a 
destructor that is being called during the "stack unwinding"process of another exception. For example, if someone says throw 
Foo(), the stack will beunwound so all the stack frames between the throw Foo() and the } catch (Foo e) { will getpopped. This is
called stack unwinding. During stack unwinding, all the local objects in allthose stack frames are destructed. If one of those 
destructors throws an exception (say it throws aBar object), the C++ runtime system is in a no-win situation: should it ignore 
the Bar and end upin the } catch (Foo e) { where it was originally headed? Should it ignore the Foo and look for a }catch (Bare) 
{ handler? There is no good answer:either choiceloses information. So the C++ language guarantees that it will call terminate() 
at this point, andterminate() kills the process. Bang you're dead.

Placement new:
There are many uses of placement new. The simplest use is to place an object at a particularlocation in memory. This is done by 
supplying the place as a pointer parameter to the new part of a new expression:

void someCode()
{
char memory[sizeof(Fred)];
void* p = memory;
Fred* f = new(p) Fred();
...
f->~Fred(); // Explicitly call the destructor for the placed object
}
This is about the only time you ever explicitly call a destructor.

Constroctors: Brace Initialization:

You can use brace initialization for any class, struct, or union. If a type has a default constructor, either implicitly or 
explicitly declared, you can use default brace initialization (with empty braces).

If a class has non-default constructors, the order in which class members appear in the brace initializer is the order in which 
the corresponding parameters appear in the constructor, not the order in which the members are declared (as with class_a in the 
previous example). Otherwise, if the type has no declared constructor, the order in which the members appear in the brace 
initializer is the same as the order in which they are declared; in this case, you can initialize as many of the public members 
as you wish, but you cannot skip any member. The following example shows the order that's used in brace initialization when 
there is no declared constructor:

class class_d {  
public:  
    float m_float;  
    string m_string;  
    wchar_t m_char;  
};  
  
int main()  
{  
    class_d d1{};  
    class_d d1{ 4.5 };  
    class_d d2{ 4.5, "string" };  
    class_d d3{ 4.5, "string", 'c' };  
  
    class_d d4{ "string", 'c' }; // compiler error  
    class_d d5("string", 'c', 2.0 }; // compiler error  
}

If the default constructor is explicitly declared but marked as deleted, default brace initialization cannot be used:
class class_f {  
public:  
    class_f() = delete;  
    class_f(string x): m_string { x } {}  
    string m_string;  
};  
int main()  
{  
    class_f cf{ "hello" };  
    class_f cf1{}; // compiler error C2280: attempting to reference a deleted function  
}  

You can use brace initialization anywhere you would typically do initialization—for example, as a function parameter or a return 
value, or with the new keyword:

class_d* cf = new class_d{4.5};
kr->add_d({ 4.5 });  
return { 4.5 }; 

Delegating Constructors:

Many classes have multiple constructors that do similar things—for example, validate parameters:
class class_c {  
public:  
    int max;  
    int min;  
    int middle;  
  
    class_c() {}  
    class_c(int my_max) {   
        max = my_max > 0 ? my_max : 10;   
    }  
    class_c(int my_max, int my_min) {   
        max = my_max > 0 ? my_max : 10;  
        min = my_min > 0 && my_min < max ? my_min : 1;  
    }  
    class_c(int my_max, int my_min, int my_middle) {  
        max = my_max > 0 ? my_max : 10;  
        min = my_min > 0 && my_min < max ? my_min : 1;  
        middle = my_middle < max && my_middle > min ? my_middle : 5;  
    }  
}; 

You could reduce the repetitive code by adding a function that does all of the validation, but the code for class_c would be easier 
to understand and maintain if one constructor could delegate some of the work to another one. To add delegating constructors, use 
the constructor (. . .) : constructor (. . .) syntax:

class class_c {  
public:  
    int max;  
    int min;  
    int middle;  
  
    class_c(int my_max) {   
        max = my_max > 0 ? my_max : 10;   
    }  
    class_c(int my_max, int my_min) : class_c(my_max) {   
        min = my_min > 0 && my_min < max ? my_min : 1;  
    }  
    class_c(int my_max, int my_min, int my_middle) : class_c (my_max, my_min){  
        middle = my_middle < max && my_middle > min ? my_middle : 5;  
}  
};  
int main() {  
  
    class_c c1{ 1, 3, 2 };  
}  

You can’t do member initialization in a constructor that delegates to another constructor, as shown here:
class class_a {  
public:  
    class_a() {}  
    // member initialization here, no delegate  
    class_a(string str) : m_string{ str } {}  
  
    //can’t do member initialization here  
    // error C3511: a call to a delegating constructor shall be the only member-initializer  
    class_a(string str, double dbl) : class_a(str) , m_double{ dbl } {}  
  
    // only member assignment  
    class_a(string str, double dbl) : class_a(str) { m_double = dbl; }  
    double m_double{ 1.0 };  
    string m_string;  
};  

Member Initializer: 
The next example shows the use of non-static data-member initializers. Notice that if a constructor also initializes a given data member, 
the member initializer is overridden:
class class_a {  
public:  
    class_a() {}  
    class_a(string str) : m_string{ str } {}  
    class_a(string str, double dbl) : class_a(str) { m_double = dbl; }  
    double m_double{ 1.0 };  
    string m_string{ m_double < 10.0 ? "alpha" : "beta" };  
};  
  
int main() {  
    class_a a{ "hello", 2.0 };  //expect a.m_double == 2.0, a.m_string == "hello"  
    int y = 4;  
} 


The constructor delegation syntax doesn't prevent the accidental creation of constructor recursion—Constructor1 calls Constructor2 which 
calls Constructor1—and no errors are thrown until there is a stack overflow. It's your responsibility to avoid cycles.
class class_f{  
public:  
    int max;  
    int min;  
  
    // don't do this  
    class_f() : class_f(6, 3){ }  
    class_f(int my_max, int my_min) : class_f() { }  
};  


SOLID design principles:
	Single Responsibility Principle
	Open/Closed Principle
	Liskov Substitution Principle
	Interface Segregation Principle
	Dependency Inversion

Single Responsibility Principle: 
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
We all know that requirements change over time. Each of them also changes the responsibility of at least one class. The more responsibilities 
your class has, the more often you need to change it. If your class implements multiple responsibilities, they are no longer independent of each other.
You need to change your class as soon as one of its responsibilities changes. That is obviously more often than you would need to change it if it 
had only one responsibility.

That might not seem like a big deal, but it also affects all classes or components that depend on the changed class. Depending on your change, you 
might need to update the dependencies or recompile the dependent classes even though they are not directly affected by your change. They only use one 
of the other responsibilities implemented by your class, but you need to update them anyway.

In the end, you need to change your class more often, and each change is more complicated, has more side-effects, and requires a lot more work than it 
should have. So, it’s better to avoid these problems by making sure that each class has only one responsibility.

Open/Closed Principle:
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
In object-oriented programming, the open/closed principle states "software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification"; that 
is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code. 

Liskov Substitution Principle :
In a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e. an object of type T may be substituted 
with any object of a subtype S) without altering any of the desirable properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.). 

Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

Bad example
public class Bird{
    public void fly(){}
}
public class Duck extends Bird{}
The duck can fly because of it is a bird, But what about this:

public class Ostrich extends Bird{}
Ostrich is a bird, But it can't fly, Ostrich class is a subtype of class Bird, But it can't use the fly method, that means that we are breaking LSP principle.

Good example
public class Bird{
}
public class FlyingBirds extends Bird{
    public void fly(){}
}
public class Duck extends FlyingBirds{}
public class Ostrich extends Bird{} 

Interface Segregation Principle :
The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. Instead of one fat interface many 
small interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each one serving one submodule.

Example:
We have a Manager class which represent the person which manages the workers. And we have 2 types of workers some average and some very efficient workers. 
Both types of workers works and they need a daily launch break to eat. But now some robots came in the company they work as well , but they don't eat so 
they don't need a launch break. One on side the new Robot class need to implement the IWorker interface because robots works. On the other side, the don't 
have to implement it because they don't eat.

This is why in this case the IWorker is considered a polluted interface.

// interface segregation principle - bad example
interface IWorker {
	public void work();
	public void eat();
}

class Worker implements IWorker{
	public void work() {// ....working}
	public void eat() {// ...... eating in launch break}
}

class SuperWorker implements IWorker{
	public void work() {//.... working much more}
	public void eat() {//.... eating in launch break}
}

class Manager {
	IWorker worker;
	public void setWorker(IWorker w) {	worker=w;}
	public void manage() {	worker.work();}
}

If we keep the present design, the new Robot class is forced to implement the eat method. We can write a dummy class which does nothing(let's say a launch 
break of 1 second daily), and can have undesired effects in the application(For example the reports seen by managers will report more lunches taken than 
the number of people).

According to the Interface Segregation Principle, a flexible design will not have polluted interfaces. In our case the IWorker interface should be split 
in 2 different interfaces.

Following it's the code supporting the Interface Segregation Principle. By splitting the IWorker interface in 2 different interfaces the new Robot class 
is no longer forced to implement the eat method. Also if we need another functionality for the robot like recharging we create another interface 
IRechargeble with a method recharge.

// interface segregation principle - good example
interface IWorker extends Feedable, Workable {}

interface IWorkable {
	public void work();
}

interface IFeedable{
	public void eat();
}

class Worker implements IWorkable, IFeedable{
	public void work() {// ....working}
	public void eat() {//.... eating in launch break}
}

class Robot implements IWorkable{
	public void work() {// ....working}
}

class SuperWorker implements IWorkable, IFeedable{
	public void work() {//.... working much more}
	public void eat() {//.... eating in launch break}
}

class Manager {
	Workable worker;
	public void setWorker(Workable w) {worker=w;}
	public void manage() {worker.work();}
}


Dependency Inversion:
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.

Imagine a world without plugs and sockets. The computer is directly soldered into an electrical wire in the wall. Whenever you buy a motherboard you also 
get a mouse, keyboard and monitor, but they're all directly soldered onto the motherboard by the manufacturer. Everything works fine, but things get 
complicated when you want to remove or replace anything. If you try to replace the mouse:

You risk damaging the motherboard
It takes forever to solder
Soldering is error prone because the new mouse has different wires
A world without plugs and sockets sounds ridiculous. Yet we programmers have a tendency to pull out the metaphorical soldering iron and hard-wire our 
classes together as we're making them. If the classes are hard-wired together, and you want to replace one of them:

You risk damaging code that uses the class
It takes forever to find and change every place that the class is used
Inserting the replacement class is error prone because it is slightly different to the old class
The Dependency Inversion Principle is basically a way of adding plugs and sockets to your code. It allows you to create your high level modules (the 
computer) independent of the low level modules (the mouse). The low level modules can be created later, and are easily replaceable.

Plugs in c++ are generally base classes with virtual methods; templating; possibly preprocessor function macros.
The plug is essentially an abstract interface. Any class can implement or inherit the abstract interface. Here is an example in C++:

//This is the "plug" (abstract base class)
class Exporter {
public:
    //pure virtual (not implemented)
    virtual String convertDocumentToString(Document* doc) = 0;
};

//This is a concrete class that implements the "plug"
class CSVExporter : public Exporter {
public:
    //concrete implementation
    String convertDocumentToString(Document* doc);
};


//Another concrete class that implements the "plug"
class XMLExporter : public Exporter {
public:
    //concrete implementation
    String convertDocumentToString(Document* doc);
};

The "sockets" are any functions or classes that use a "plug". Continuing from the above code example, below is an example of a "socket" class.
//Class with an Exporter "socket"
class ExportController {
private:
    Exporter* m_exporter;
public:
    //this is the socket that accepts Exporter plugs
    void setExporter(Exporter* exporter);
    void runExport();
};

// ... (code omitted)

void ExportController::runExport()
{
    Document* currentDocument = GetCurrentDocument();
    String exportedString = m_exporter->convertDocumentToString(currentDocument);
    String exportFilePath = GetSaveFilePath();
    WriteStringToFile(exporterString, exportFilePath);
}

n the above example, the ExportController is the "higher level" module and all the Exporter subclasses are the "lower level" modules. This is because 
ExportController uses the Exporter subclasses, and not the other way around. The application of the DIP means that ExportController has no knowledge of 
CSVExporter, XMLExporter, or any other Exporter subclass. It only knows about the abstract Exporter interface.

Named Constructor Idiom or Just Names Constructors:
The problem is that constructors always have the same name as the class. Therefore the only way to differentiate between the various constructors of a 
class is by the parameter list. But if there are lots of constructors, the differences between them become somewhat subtle and error prone.

With the Named Constructor Idiom, you declare all the class's constructors in the private or protected sections, and you provide public static methods 
that return an object. These static methods are the so-called "Named Constructors." In general there is one such static method for each different way 
to construct an object.

Inheritance:
Inheritance allows one class to reuse the state and behavior of another class. The derived class inherits the properties and method implementations of 
the base class and extends it by overriding methods and adding additional properties and methods.

Object Slicing in C++:
In C++, a derived class object can be assigned to a base class object, but the other way is not possible.
Object slicing happens when a derived class object is assigned to a base class object, additional attributes of a derived class object are sliced off 
to form the base class object.

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 

class Base 
{ 
protected: 
	int i; 
public: 
	Base(int a)	 { i = a; } 
	virtual void display() 
	{ cout << "I am Base class object, i = " << i << endl; } 
}; 

class Derived : public Base 
{ 
	int j; 
public: 
	Derived(int a, int b) : Base(a) { j = b; } 
	virtual void display() 
	{ cout << "I am Derived class object, i = "
		<< i << ", j = " << j << endl; } 
}; 

// Global method, Base class object is passed by value 
void somefunc (Base obj) 
{ 
	obj.display(); 
} 

int main() 
{ 
	Base b(33); 
	Derived d(45, 54); 
	somefunc(b); 
	somefunc(d); // Object Slicing, the member j of d is sliced off 
	return 0; 
} 

Output:

I am Base class object, i = 33
I am Base class object, i = 45

We can avoid above unexpected behavior with the use of pointers or references. Object slicing doesn’t occur when pointers or references to objects are 
passed as function arguments since a pointer or reference of any type takes same amount of memory. For example, if we change the global method myfunc() 
in the above program to following, object slicing doesn’t happen.

// rest of code is similar to above 
void somefunc (Base &obj) 
{ 
	obj.display(); 
}		 
// rest of code is similar to above 

We get the same output if we use pointers and change the program to following.

// rest of code is similar to above 
void somefunc (Base *objp) 
{ 
	objp->display(); 
} 

int main() 
{ 
	Base *bp = new Base(33) ; 
	Derived *dp = new Derived(45, 54); 
	somefunc(bp); 
	somefunc(dp); // No Object Slicing 
	return 0; 
} 

Output:

I am Base class object, i = 33
I am Derived class object, i = 45, j = 54
Object slicing can be prevented by making the base class function pure virtual there by disallowing object creation. It is not possible to create the 
object of a class which contains a pure virtual method.

A FUNCTION is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the 
return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.

A METHOD is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two 
key differences:
A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.
A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the 
definition, the object is an instance of that data).

Explain the ISA and HASA class relationships. How would you implement each in a class design?
A: A specialized class "is" a specialization of another class and, therefore, has the ISArelationship with the other class. This relationship is best 
implemented by embedding an object of the Salary class in the Employee class.

Function overloading and const keyword:

#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 

class Test 
{ 
protected: 
	int x; 
public: 
	Test (int i):x(i) { } 
	void fun() const{cout << "fun() const called " << endl;	} 
	void fun() {cout << "fun() called " << endl;} 
}; 

int main() 
{ 
	Test t1 (10); 
	const Test t2 (20); 
	t1.fun(); 
	t2.fun(); 
	return 0; 
} 

Output: The above program compiles and runs fine, and produces following output.

fun() called
fun() const called

The two methods ‘void fun() const’ and ‘void fun()’ have same signature except that one is const and other is not. Also, if we take a closer look at the 
output, we observe that, ‘const void fun()’ is called on const object and ‘void fun()’ is called on non-const object. C++ allows member methods to be 
overloaded on the basis of const type. Overloading on the basis of const type can be useful when a function return reference or pointer. We can make one 
function const, that returns a const reference or const pointer, other non-const function, that returns non-const reference or pointer.

What about parameters?
Rules related to const parameters are interesting. Let us first take a look at following two examples. The program 1 fails in compilation, but program 2 
compiles and runs fine.

// PROGRAM 1 (Fails in compilation) 
#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 

void fun(const int i) { cout << "fun(const int) called "; } 
void fun(int i) { cout << "fun(int ) called " ; } 
int main() { 
	const int i = 10; 
	fun(i); 
	return 0; 
} 

Output:

Compiler Error: redefinition of 'void fun(int)'

// PROGRAM 2 (Compiles and runs fine) 
#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 

void fun(char *a) { cout << "non-const fun() " << a; } 

void fun(const char *a) { cout << "const fun() " << a; } 

int main() 
{ 
const char *ptr = "GeeksforGeeks"; 
fun(ptr); 
return 0; 
} 

Output:

const fun() GeeksforGeeks

C++ allows functions to be overloaded on the basis of const-ness of parameters only if the const parameter is a reference or a pointer. That is why the program 1 
failed in compilation, but the program 2 worked fine. This rule actually makes sense. In program 1, the parameter ‘i’ is passed by value, so ‘i’ in fun() is a 
copy of ‘i’ in main(). Hence fun() cannot modify ‘i’ of main(). Therefore, it doesn’t matter whether ‘i’ is received as a const parameter or normal parameter. 
When we pass by reference or pointer, we can modify the value referred or pointed, so we can have two versions of a function, one which can modify the referred 
or pointed value, other which can not.

Argument Dependant Lookup:
Koenig Lookup, or Argument Dependent Lookup, describes how unqualified names are looked up by the compiler in C++.

You don’t have to qualify the namespace for functions if one or more argument types are defined in the namespace of the function.
A simple code example:

namespace MyNamespace
{
    class MyClass {};
    void doSomething(MyClass);
}

MyNamespace::MyClass obj; // global object


int main()
{
    doSomething(obj); // Works Fine - MyNamespace::doSomething() is called.
}


Koenig Lookup, or Argument Dependent Lookup, describes how unqualified names are looked up by the compiler in C++.

The C++11 standard § 3.4.2/1 states:

When the postfix-expression in a function call (5.2.2) is an unqualified-id, other namespaces not considered during the usual unqualified lookup (3.4.1) may be 
searched, and in those namespaces, namespace-scope friend function declarations (11.3) not otherwise visible may be found. These modifications to the search 
depend on the types of the arguments (and for template template arguments, the namespace of the template argument).

In simpler terms:
You don’t have to qualify the namespace for functions if one or more argument types are defined in the namespace of the function.
In Koenig Lookup, if a function is called without specifying its namespace, then the name of a function is also searched in namespace(s) in which the type of the 
argument(s) is defined. That is why it is also known as Argument-Dependent name Lookup, in short simply ADL.

A simple code example:

namespace MyNamespace
{
    class MyClass {};
    void doSomething(MyClass);
}

MyNamespace::MyClass obj; // global object


int main()
{
    doSomething(obj); // Works Fine - MyNamespace::doSomething() is called.
}
In the above example there is neither a using-declaration nor a using-directive but still the compiler correctly identifies the unqualified name doSomething() as 
the function declared in namespace MyNamespace by applying Koenig lookup.

How does it work?
The algorithm tells the compiler to not just look at local scope, but also the namespaces that contain the argument's type. Thus, in the above code, the compiler 
finds that the object obj, which is the argument of the function doSomething(), belongs to the namespace MyNamespace. So, it looks at that namespace to locate the 
declaration of doSomething().

What is the advantage of Koenig lookup?
As the simple code example above demonstrates above, Koenig lookup provides convenience and ease of usage to the programmer. Without Koenig lookup there would be 
an overhead on the programmer, to repeatedly specify the fully qualified names, or instead, use numerous using-declarations.

Why the criticism of Koenig lookup?
Over-reliance on Koenig lookup can lead to semantic problems, and catch the programmer off guard sometimes.

Consider the example of std::swap, which is a standard library algorithm to swap two values. With the Koenig lookup one would have to be cautious while using this 
algorithm because:

std::swap(obj1,obj2);
may not show the same behavior as:

using std::swap;
swap(obj1, obj2);
With ADL, which version of swap function gets called would depend on the namespace of the arguments passed to it.

If there exists an namespace A and if A::obj1, A::obj2 & A::swap() exist then the second example will result in a call to A::swap(), which might not be what the 
user wanted.

Further, if for some reason both A::swap(A::MyClass&, A::MyClass&) and std::swap(A::MyClass&, A::MyClass&) are defined, then the first example will call 
std::swap(A::MyClass&, A::MyClass&) but the second will not compile because swap(obj1, obj2) would be ambiguous.

Trivia:
Why is it called “Koenig lookup”?
Because it was devised by former AT&T and Bell Labs researcher and programmer, Andrew Koenig.

Curiously Recurring Template Pattern: CRTP

C++ provides pretty good support for polymorphism by means of virtual functions. This is dynamic polymorphism (or runtime polymorphism), since the actual function 
to be called is resolved at runtime. It's usually implemented by adding a hidden pointer in every object of a class with virtual functions. The pointer will point 
for any given object at the actual functions to call for it, so even when the compiler only knows this object through a pointer to a base class, it can generate 
correct code.

The problem with dynamic polymorphism is its runtime cost. This usually consists of the following components [1]:

Extra indirection (pointer dereference) for each call to a virtual method.
Virtual methods usually can't be inlined, which may be a significant cost hit for some small methods.
Additional pointer per object. On 64-bit systems which are prevalent these days, this is 8 bytes per object. For small objects that carry little data this may be a 
serious overhead.
Although in general dynamic polymorphism is a great tool, due to the aforementioned costs some applications prefer not to use it, at least for some performance-
critical classes. So what is the alterantive?

It turns out that using templates, C++ provides an alternative way to implement polymorphism without the extra costs. There's a catch, of course - the types of 
objects have to be resolvable by the compiler at compile-time. This is called static polymorphism (or "simulated dynamic binding").

Here's the simplest code sample I could come up with that demonstrates the technique:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <typename Child>
struct Base
{
    void interface()
    {
        static_cast<Child*>(this)->implementation();
    }
};

struct Derived : Base<Derived>
{
    void implementation()
    {
        cerr << "Derived implementation\n";
    }
};

int main()
{
    Derived d;
    d.interface();  // Prints "Derived implementation"
}

The key to the technique is the strange template trickery that's being used: note that Derived inherits from Base<Derived>. What gives? The idea is to "inject" the 
real type of the derived class into the base, at compile time, allowing the static_cast of this in the interface to produce the desired result. This technique has 
a name - it's called Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP from now on).
Synthetic examples are prone to not being exciting, and this one is no exception. Why not just implement interface in Derived, if its type is known at compile-time 
anyway, you may ask. This is a good question, which is why I plan to provide more examples to show how CRTP is useful.
The following example is much longer - although it is also a simplification. It presents a generic base class for visiting binary trees in various orders. This base 
class can be inherited to specify special handling of some types of nodes. Here is the tree node definition and the base class:

struct TreeNode
{
    enum Kind {RED, BLUE};

    TreeNode(Kind kind_, TreeNode* left_ = NULL, TreeNode* right_ = NULL)
        : kind(kind_), left(left_), right(right_)
    {}

    Kind kind;
    TreeNode *left, *right;
};

template <typename Derived>
class GenericVisitor
{
public:
    void visit_preorder(TreeNode* node)
    {
        if (node) {
            dispatch_node(node);
            visit_preorder(node->left);
            visit_preorder(node->right);
        }
    }

    void visit_inorder(TreeNode* node)
    {
        if (node) {
            visit_inorder(node->left);
            dispatch_node(node);
            visit_inorder(node->right);
        }
    }

    void visit_postorder(TreeNode* node)
    {
        if (node) {
            visit_postorder(node->left);
            visit_postorder(node->right);
            dispatch_node(node);
        }
    }

    void handle_RED(TreeNode* node)
    {
        cerr << "Generic handle RED\n";
    }

    void handle_BLUE(TreeNode* node)
    {
        cerr << "Generic handle BLUE\n";
    }

private:
    // Convenience method for CRTP
    //
    Derived& derived()
    {
        return *static_cast<Derived*>(this);
    }

    void dispatch_node(TreeNode* node)
    {
        switch (node->kind) {
            case TreeNode::RED:
                derived().handle_RED(node);
                break;
            case TreeNode::BLUE:
                derived().handle_BLUE(node);
                break;
            default:
                assert(0);
        }
    }
};
And a simple derived class:

class SpecialVisitor : public GenericVisitor<SpecialVisitor>
{
public:
    void handle_RED(TreeNode* node)
    {
        cerr << "RED is special\n";
    }
};

Now you can easily implement special handling of various kinds of nodes in subclasses, and use visiting services provided by the base class.

To reiterate - this is a simplified example, as there are only two kinds of nodes, but in reality there can be many more. Such code would be quite useful 
inside compilers, where the source is usually parsed into a tree with many different kinds of nodes. Multiple passes in the compiler then process the trees 
by implementing their own visitors. As a matter of fact, the Clang compiler frontend has such a class, named RecursiveASTVisitor, which implements a much 
more complete version of the visitor displayed above.

Without CRTP, there's no way to implement such functionality except resorting to dynamic polymorphism and virtual functions [2].

Another interesting example is the following:

template <typename Derived>
struct Comparisons
{
};


template <typename Derived>
bool operator==(const Comparisons<Derived>& o1, const Comparisons<Derived>& o2)
{
    const Derived& d1 = static_cast<const Derived&>(o1);
    const Derived& d2 = static_cast<const Derived&>(o2);

    return !(d1 < d2) && !(d2 < d1);
}


template <typename Derived>
bool operator!=(const Comparisons<Derived>& o1, const Comparisons<Derived>& o2)
{
    return !(o1 == o2);
}
This is a generic base class with some external comparison functions that act on it. What this makes possible is to create a derived class that only defines 
the < operator, making other comparison operators (== and != here, but others are trivial to add) possible. Here's a sample derived class:

class Person : public Comparisons<Person>
{
public:
    Person(string name_, unsigned age_)
        : name(name_), age(age_)
    {}

    friend bool operator<(const Person& p1, const Person& p2);
private:
    string name;
    unsigned age;
};


bool operator<(const Person& p1, const Person& p2)
{
    return p1.age < p2.age;
}

Again, this is using CRTP to implement something that could only be possible with virtual functions had we wanted dynamic polymorphism. Sometimes a class like 
Comparisons above is called a mixin class:

In object-oriented programming languages, a mixin is a class that provides a certain functionality to be inherited or just reused by a subclass, while not meant 
for instantiation (the generation of objects of that class). Inheriting from a mixin is not a form of specialization but is rather a means of collecting 
functionality. A class may inherit most or all of its functionality from one or more mixins through multiple inheritance.

So how often is CRTP used in "real life"? I don't have any actual usage statistics, but it appears that this is a useful tool in a C++ programmer's toolbox. 
The RecursiveASTVisitor class from Clang I mentioned above is a very real use case. Clang's parent project LLVM uses CRTP in at least another place (the 
HeuristicBase class in the code generator module).

Boost also uses CRTP for its Iterator Facade:

iterator_facade is a base class template that implements the interface of standard iterators in terms of a few core functions and associated types, to be 
supplied by a derived iterator class.
And finally, Microsoft's Active Template Library (ATL) uses CRTP comprehensively. See, for example, the CWindowImpl template.


What a derived class doesnt inherit from base class:

The base class's constructors and destructor.
The base class's assignment operator.
The base class's friends

Q: What are the differences between a C++ struct and C++ class?
A: The default member and base class access specifies are different. This is one of the commonly misunderstood aspects of C++. Believe it or not, many programmers 
think that a C++ struct is just like a C struct, while a C++ class has inheritance, access specifes, member functions, overloaded operators, and so on. Actually, 
the C++ struct has all the features of the class. The only differences are that a struct defaults to public member access and public base class inheritance, and a 
class defaults to the private access specified and private base-class inheritance.
